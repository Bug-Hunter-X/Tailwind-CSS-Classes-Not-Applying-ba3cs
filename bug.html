The following Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly: \"bg-gray-200\", \"p-4\", \"rounded-lg\".  I've included them in my HTML element, but the styles aren't showing up. My HTML looks like this:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
  This text should have a gray background, padding, and rounded corners.
</div>
```

I've confirmed that Tailwind CSS is properly installed and configured, and I've purged the CSS.
