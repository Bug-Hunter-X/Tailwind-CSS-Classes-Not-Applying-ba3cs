# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug where standard Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied to an HTML element.  Despite proper configuration and purging, the classes `bg-gray-200`, `p-4`, and `rounded-lg` fail to render the expected styles.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic HTML, and the `bugSolution.html` file offers a possible solution. The issue might stem from incorrect configuration, conflicting CSS, or an oversight in the HTML structure.
