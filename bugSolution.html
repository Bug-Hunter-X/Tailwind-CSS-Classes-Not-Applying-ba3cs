The problem was likely caused by a missing or incorrect configuration of the Tailwind directives in your main CSS file or a build process problem.  Here's how to ensure your Tailwind directives are correctly set up in your CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

If you are using a build process (like Vite, Webpack, etc.), make sure it's correctly configured to process your Tailwind CSS. This often involves adding the Tailwind directives to a file that is then processed by your build tool.  The exact steps depend on your build system and setup. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for your specific build system for details. Another potential solution involves ensuring that you have purged your CSS after adding or removing classes.  This process generates the necessary CSS for your specific classes. If the problem still exists, double check if any other CSS rules could be overriding your Tailwind classes.
